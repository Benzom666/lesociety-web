                We are anticipating a large community of gentlemen with high
                social status, and by securing their profiles we are preventing
                any member from attempting to commit identity theft, stalking,
                black mailing, or potentially having their colleagues stumble
                across their profile. On Le Society our gentlemen get to choose
                who can see their profile by simply sending a message to that
                specific female user.
