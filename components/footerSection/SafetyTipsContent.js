          We want to make sure that your online dating experience is secure.
          When you are speaking or messaging someone or arranging a
          meet-and-greet, keep these suggestions in mind.
        </p>

      <div className="safety__content__text">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Never meet someone at their car, in the parking lot, at a hotel or
            motel, or any other location where you feel you can't leave right
            away or safely. Whenever you feel uneasy, trust your instincts and
            leave the situation. Don't think twice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Just in case Avoid using your full name as your username when
            chatting online. Just use your first name or come up with a harmless
            email address and a random name. Come up with a clever nameÂ to use.
          </li>

          <li>
            Avoid using images from Instagram or Facebook in your online
            profile. They are simple to find. Don't connect any online dating
            services, such as Tinder or Instagram, to your social media
            accounts. One of the quickest methods for someone to locate you and
            find out everything about you, your friends, and family is through
            social media.
          </li>

          <li>
            Getting a peek of your date before you meet them is a smart idea.
            The use of video chat is widespread (FaceTime, Google Hangouts,
            Skype and even Facebook). This may also lessen the chance of being
            "catfished" by someone posing as someone they are not.
          </li>

          <li>
            If the online conversation gets out of hand stop the chat and make
            sure you have tools to ban and report this individual, if they make
            you feel uncomfortable.
          </li>

          <li>
            Be rational. Sending images right away, especially explicit ones, is
            not advised. Never divulge your phone number (create a WhatsApp
            account or Google voice number or get a burner phone). When speaking
            with someone, use caution when discussing your location, recent
            events you attended, your place of employment, or anything else that
            could easily identify you as someone they may know. I realize you're
            probably talking to someone in the area, but until you're certain,
            it's best to be safe than sorry.
          </li>

          <li>Never provide financial details or money online.</li>

          <li>
            Never disclose your address or whether you live alone to someone you
            don't know or just met. Never let them know where you can be found
            and have them meet you there. In the event that you decide to meet,
            be sure to do so in a well-known public area and let people know
            where you'll be. Even better, you can bring a wingwoman or man
            along.
          </li>

          <li>
            Be attentive. Examine the facial expressions and body language of
            others.
          </li>

          <li>
            Make sure to literally watch your drink if you're meeting in a pub.
            Not simply how much alcohol you consume (not much), but also keeping
            the drink in your immediate vicinity at all times. Roofies, among
            other narcotics, are simple to use and are undetectable until it is
            too late.
          </li>

          <li>
            Make sure you have your own vehicle, access to public
            transportation, friends you can call, or a mobile app that can send
            someone to pick you up. Accepting a ride or walking back won't help
            you because 1) they'll know where you live and 2) you never know
            where you'll end up.
          </li>

          <li>Always have enough money on you to get home.</li>
