            content={`This Agreement is subject to change by the Company at any
            time. If You are a non-subscribing Member at the time of any change,
            the revised terms will be effective when posted on the Website and
            your use of the Service after such posting will constitute acceptance
            by You of the revised Agreement. If You are a subscribing Member at
            the time of any change, to the extent permitted by applicable law the
            then-existing Agreement will continue to govern your Membership until
            such time that your Membership is renewed (whether by You or
            automatically by the Service) as contemplated herein. If You continue
            your Membership, your renewal will constitute acceptance by You of the
            revised Agreement. Alternatively, if You terminate your subscription
            at such time, your use of the Service after your termination will
            constitute acceptance by You of the then-existing Agreement. 
            Summary: When we revise this Agreement, depending on your status
            (non-subscribing or subscribing), You may be subject to different
            terms (old or new) for a period of time.`}
